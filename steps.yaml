We have to do step by step ---

Checks if the browser supports geolocation.

Set options for high accuracy a 5-second timeout, and no caching. 

Use watchposition to track the user's location cotinuously.

Emit the latitude and longitude via a socket with "send location". 

Log any errors to the console.

Intialize a map centered at coordinates(0, 0) with a zoom level of 15 using Leaflet. Add OpenStreamMap Tiles to the map.

Create an empty object markers.

When receiving location data via the socket, extract id, latitude, and longitude, and center the map on the new coordinates.

If a marker for the id exits, upadtes its position, otherwise create a new marker at the given coordinates and add it to the map. When a user disconnects, removes their marker from the map and delete it form markers.
