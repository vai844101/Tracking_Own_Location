Build a real-time device tracking application using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Leaflet.
**Socket.io** and **Leaflet** are used to build real-time, interactive web applications, particularly for scenarios involving live updates and geospatial data visualization.
**Socket.io** is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between web clients and servers.
**Leaflet** is a lightweight, open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
When combined, Socket.io and Leaflet can create powerful real-time mapping applications.
